# Picker v0.0.0

> Picker is a general library for pickers, used primarily in [Vizabi](https://github.com/Gapminder/vizabi)

## Getting started
You can simply grab a copy of the necessary files in the folder ```dist```. You need to include jQuery, Picker's javascript file and the CSS file to your ```<head>``` tag to get it up and running properly:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/picker.min.css">
<!-- Javascript (may be placed at the bottom, inside the <body> tag) -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="picker.min.js"></script>
```
