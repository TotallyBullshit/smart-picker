# pickers v0.0.0

> General library for pickers - to be used primarily in Vizabi

## Getting started
You can simply grab a copy of the necessary files in the folder ```dist```. You need to include jQuery, the Pickers javascript file and the CSS file to your ```<head>``` tag to get it up and running properly:

```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/pickers.min.css">
<!-- Javascript (may be placed at the bottom, inside the <body> tag) -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="pickers.min.js"></script>
```
